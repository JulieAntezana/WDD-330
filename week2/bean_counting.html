<h1>WDD 330 Portfolio</h1>
<h2>Bean Counting</h2>
<div id="bean">
  <p>You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string"[N]. The returned value will be a string containing only one character (for example, "b"). The first character has position 0, which causes the last one to be found at position string.length - 1. In other words, a two-character string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.</p>

  <p>Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters there are in the string.</p>

  <p>Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.</p>

  <p>(See console for result. Expected results: 2, 4)</p>
</div>

    }
  }
  return counted;
}

function countBs(string) {
  return countChar(string, "B");
}

console.log(countBs("BBC"));
// → 2
console.log(countChar("kakkerlak", "k"));
// → 4
