CHAPTER 8 FORMS

<form> element contains controls such as input fields, select menus, and buttons. We will be looking at how to process form submission in JS. Can also be processed on backend using PHP or Ruby or others.

 

Working with the following sample code:

<!doctype html>

<html lang='en'>

<head>

<meta charset='utf-8'>

<title>Search</title>

</head>

<body>

<form name='search' action='/search'>

<input name='searchInput'>

<button type='submit'>Search</button>

</form>

<script src='search.js'></script>

</body>

</html>

 

DOM legacy property: document.forms

Const form = document.forms[0];  /

Const form = document.forms.search;

Const form = document.forms[‘search’];

Const [input, button] = forms.elements;  //form object containing form elements

 

Form properties and methods:

Form.submit() will submit the form automatically.

A form can be submitted manually by the user using a button or input element with type attribute set to submit

<button type = ‘submit’ >Submit</button>

<input type =’submit’ vaule=’Submit’>

 

Form.reset() resets all form controls back to initial values from HTML

<button type=’reset’>Reset</button>  //use reset with CAUTION. User form data gets removed and will have to be re-entered.

 

Form.action property can be used to set the action attribute of a form

Form.action = ‘/an/other.url’  send user to another url could be an example

 

Form Events:

Focus event occurs when an element is focused on. Like when the cursor is placed inside an input element.

 const input = form.elements.searchInput;

input.addEventListener("focus", () => alert("focused"), false);

 

Blur event occurs when the users moves the focus away from the form element.

input.addEventListener("blur", () => alert("blurred"), false);

 

Change event occurs when user moves the focus away from the form after changing it. If no changes were made the blur event will fire in its place. If changes were made “change” event will fire followed by “blur”.

 

 

Submit event occurs when form is submitted. Usually submit sends the form to the server to be processed. We can intercept the form before it is sent by adding the submit event listener.

form.addEventListener("submit", search, false);

function search() {

  alert(" Form Submitted");

}

Backend processing is common but JS can also process the submitted data.

 

Retrieving and Changing

 Values From a Form

form.addEventListener("submit", search, false);

function search(event) {

  alert(`You Searched for: ${input.value}`);

  event.preventDefault();

}

input.value = "Search Here"; //similar to html placeholder

input.addEventListener(

  "focus",

  function () {

    if (input.value === "Search Here") {

      input.value = "";

    }

  },

  false

);

input.addEventListener(

  "blur",

  function () {

    if (input.value === "") {

      input.value = "Search Here";

    }

  },

  false

);

 

Form Controls:

<input> fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads

<select> menus for drop-down lists of options

<textarea> elements for longer text entry

<button> elements for submitting and resetting forms

 

Using this code sample:

<!doctype html>

<html lang='en'>

<head>

<meta charset='utf-8'>

<title>Hero Form</title>

</head>

<body>

<form id='hero'>

<label for='heroName'>Name:

<input type='text' id='heroName' name='heroName'

autofocus placeholder='Your Super Hero Name' maxlength=32>

</label>

<label for="realName">Real Name:

<input type="password" name="realName" id="realName"/></label>

<button type='submit'>Submit</button>

</form>

<script src='hero.js'></script>

</body>

</html>

 

Autofocus attribute gives this element focus when the page is loaded.

Placeholder provides a hint to user

Maxlength attribute limits character length into input field

 

 

//making a superhero object from form input

const form = document.forms["hero"];

form.addEventListener("submit", makeHero, false);

function makeHero(event) {

  event.preventDefault(); // prevent the form from being submitted

  const hero = {}; // create an empty object

  hero.name = form.heroName.value; // create a name property based on the input field's value

  alert(JSON.stringify(hero)); // convert object to JSON string and display in alert dialog

  return hero;

}

 

Input Fields

Text Input: is default so type=’text’ is not required

The initial value of the text input can be set using value attribute

<label for='donation-amount'>Enter amount to donate:

<input type='text' id ='donation-amount'

name='donationAmount' value='10'>

</label>

 

Password input: type=’password’ is used to conceal characters on screen

Html

<input type="password" name="realName" id="realName"/>

JS

hero.realName = form.realName.value;

 

Checkbox inputs type=’checkbox’ are used to select different options that can be checked(true) or unchecked(false). User can select more than one from list

 

Additional html code:

<p>Super Powers:</p>

      <label for="flight"

        >Flight:

        <input type="checkbox" id="flight" value="Flight" name="powers" />

      </label>

      <label for="strength"

        >Super Strength:

        <input type="checkbox" id="strength" value="Strength" name="powers" />

      </label>

      <label for="speed"

        >Super Speed:

        <input type="checkbox" id="speed" value="Super Speed" name="powers" />

      </label>

      <label for="energy"

        >Energy Blasts:

        <input

          type="checkbox"

          id="energy"

          value="Energy Blasts"

          name="powers"

        />

      </label>

      <label for="telekinesis"

        >Telekinesis:

        <input

          type="checkbox"

          id="telekinesis"

          value="Telekinesis"

          name="powers"

        />

      </label>

 Note how each checkbox element has the same name property of ‘powers’ that can be accessed as an html collection via form.powers;

 

//using checkboxes - checking for the checked box

hero.powers = [];

for (let i = 0; i < form.powers.length; i++) {

  if (form.powers[i].checked) {

    hero.powers.push(form.powers[i].value);

  }

}

This creates a powers property for our hero object that starts as an empty array.

We then iterate over each checkbox to see if it was checked in the form. If it was,

we add the value property of the checkbox to the powers array using the push

method.

This can be shortened considerably by using filter:

// shorter version

hero.powers = [...form.powers]

  .filter((box) => box.checked)

  .map((box) => box.value);

This uses the spread operator to turn the node list into an array. This then allows

us to use the filter() method that returns an array containing only the check

boxes that were checked (this is because their checked property will be truthy).

We then chain the map() method to the end, which replaces each checkbox in the

array with its value property. This array is then returned and stored in the

hero.powers variable.

 

Checkbox can be set to true by default:

Html :  <input type='checkbox' value='Flight' name='powers'

checked>

JS : document.forms.hero.powers[0].checked = true;

 

Radio Button Input:  type=’radio’ only one can be selected

<p>What type of hero are you?</p>

      <label for="hero"

        >Hero:

        <input type="radio" name="category" value="Hero" id="hero" />

      </label>

      <label for="villain"

        >Villain:

        <input type="radio" name="category" value="Villain" id="villain" />

      </label>

      <label for="anti-hero"

        >Anti-Hero:

        <input type="radio" name="category" value="Antihero" id="anti-hero" />

      </label>

 

Each has name attribute of ‘category’ that groups them together.

 

Hidden Input type=’hidden’ not displayed by browser. Often used to send information such as settings or information already provided by user.

 

File Input type=’file’ used to upload files

 

Other Inputs:

Number

Tel

Color

 

      <label for="City"

        >Base of Operations:

        <select name="city" id="city">

          <option value="" selected>Choose a City</option>

          <option value="Metropolis">Metropolis</option>

          <option value="Gotham City">Gotham City</option>

          <option value="Keystone City">Keystone ➥ City</option>

          <option value="Coast City">Coast City</option>

          <option value="Star City">Star City</option>

        </select>

      </label>

Note that the selected attribute can be used to set the initial value in the HTML.

 

<textarea> element is used to enter long pieces of text over multiple lines such as a comment or blog post.

      <textarea name="origin" rows="20" cols="60">

Born as Kal-El on the planet Krypton...</textarea>

 

Buttons

Different types. Default is submit.

<button type='reset'>Reset</button>  will reset all form inputs --- CAUTION: not recommended for usability reasons

 

<button type='button'>Click Me</button> //simply creates a clickable button that can have an

event listener attached to it

 

<button type='menu'>Menu</button>

 

Form Validation: process of checking whether a user has entered the information into a form correctly

Validation can occur on the client side using JavaScript, and on the server side. It is advisable to use both client-side and server-side validation. JavaScript should not be relied upon to validate any data before it’s saved to a database. JavaScript validation should be used to enhance the user experience when filling in a form by giving feedback about any errors before it’s submitted.

 

Custom validation example:

//custom validation

form.addEventListener("submit", validate, false);

function validate(event) {

  const firstLetter = form.heroName.value[0];

  if (firstLetter.toUpperCase() === "X") {

    event.preventDefault();

    alert("Your name is not allowed to start with X!");

  }

}   //it worked

We start by finding the first letter of the value entered in the name field using the index notation (remember that an index of 0 represents the first letter in a string). It then checks to see if the first letter is equal to the string literal X, and alerts the user if this is the case. It also uses the preventDefault() method to stop the form from being submitted. Otherwise it returns true, which means the form is

submitted as normal.

 

//provide instant validation feedback before submission

const label = form.querySelector("label");

const error = document.createElement("div");

error.classList.add("error");

error.textContent = "! Your name is not allowed to start with X.";

label.append(error);

function validateInline() {

  const heroName = this.value.toUpperCase();

  if (heroName.startsWith("X")) {

    error.style.display = "block";

  } else {

    error.style.display = "none";

  }

}

 

Disabling the submit button with ‘disabled’ attribute

<button type='submit' id='submit' disabled>Submit</button>

Can also be disabled via JS.

function disableSubmit(event) {

if(event.target.value === ''){

document.getElementById('submit').disabled = true;

} else {

document.getElementById('submit').disabled = false;

}

}

 

Forms are the primary method used for entering data into a browser.

Forms have a variety of controls that are used for entering different types of information.

HTML5 has a large number of new input types that are beginning to be implemented in modern browsers.

document.forms will return an HTML collection of all the forms on a page.

form.elements will return an HTML collection of all the elements contained within a form.

Forms have focus, blur, and change events that fire as a user interacts with the form.

Forms also have a submit event that can be used to intercept a form before it’s been submitted.

The information entered into a form can be read or updated using the value property of the form controls.

The HTML5 form validation API can be used to automatically validate a form, but only at a basic level, so a custom validation script may be required.

CHAPTER 12

Object-Oriented Programming in JS

A style of programming that

involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods. There are three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.

 

Encapsulation

The inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and only the essential functionalities are exposed to the end user, such as the “on” button. This involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality, without the outside world needing to know how it’s done.

 

Polymorphism:

the same process can be used for different objects.

This means various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.

 

Inheritance:

taking the features of one object then adding some new features. In OOP, this means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.

 

Classes:

Classes are a blueprint for an object. Objects are then created as an instance of that class, and inherit all the properties and methods of the class.

 

Constructor Functions:

This is a function that defines the properties and methods of an object. Here is the

dice example rewritten as a constructor function:

 

const Dice = function(sides=6){

this.sides = sides;

this.roll = function() {

return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)

}

}

The keyword ‘this’ is used to represent the object that will be returned by the constructor function. In the previous example, we use it to set the sides property to the argument that is provided to the constructor function, or 6, if no argument is provided. It also adds a method called roll(), which returns a random number from 1 up to the number of sides the dice has.

We can now create an instance of the dice constructor function using the new operator.

const redDice = new Dice();

<< Dice { sides: 6, roll: [Function] }

This returns an object that was assigned to the variable redDice, which is said to

be an instance of the Dice constructor function. We can confirm this using the

instanceof operator:

redDice instanceof Dice

<< true

 

redDice.sides

<< 6

redDice.roll()

When Parentheses Aren’t Required

The parentheses are not required when instantiating a new object using a

constructor function. The following code would also achieve the same result:

const redDice = new Dice;

 

Class Declaration: By convention, the names of constructor functions or class declarations are capitalized, which is the convention used for classes in class-based programming languages. The class declaration syntax works in exactly the same way as the constructor function syntax.

 

class Dice {

constructor(sides=6) {

this.sides = sides;

}

roll() {

return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)

}

}

 

Constructor Property:

All objects have a constructor property that returns the constructor function that

created it:

blueDice.constructor

<< [Function: Dice]

 

We can use the constructor property to instantiate a copy of an object, without having to reference the actual constructor function or class declaration directly. For example, if we wanted to make another copy of the redDice object, but if the name of its constructor was unknown, we could use the following:

 

const greenDice = new redDice.constructor(10);

greenDice instanceOf Dice

<< true

 

Static Methods:

The static keyword can be used in class declarations to create a static method. A static method is called by the class directly rather than by instances of the class. For example, the Dice class could have a method

 

class Dice {

constructor(sides=6) {

this.sides = sides;

}

roll() {

return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)

}

static description() {

return 'A way of choosing random numbers'

}

}

This method is called from the Dice class like so:

Dice.description()

<< 'A way of choosing random numbers'

 

Static methods are not available to instances of the class. So, in our example, the

instances of Dice such as redDice and blueDice cannot call the static

description() method:

redDice.description

<< TypeError: red.description is not a function

 

Prototypal Inheritance:

Every class has a prototype property that is shared by every instance of the class. So any properties or methods of a class’s prototype can be accessed by every object instantiated by

that class.

To see how this works, let’s create a class for creating ninja turtles:

class Turtle {

constructor(name) {

this.name = name;

this.weapon = 'hands';

}

sayHi() {

return `Hi dude, my name is ${this.name}`;

}

attack(){

return `Feel the power of my ${this.weapon}!`;

}

}

This can then be used to create a new turtle instance:

const leo = new Turtle('Leonardo');

<< Turtle { name: 'Leonardo' }

The variable leo points to an instance of the Turtle class. It has a name property

and a sayHi() method that references the name property:

leo.name;

<< 'Leonardo'

leo.sayHi();

<< 'Hi dude, my name is Leonardo'

 

Prototype Property: All classes and constructor functions have a prototype property that returns an object:

Turtle.prototype;

<< Turtle {}

All instances of the Turtle class share all the properties and methods of its prototype. This means they can call any methods of the prototype and access any of its properties. Since the prototype is just an object, we can add new properties by assignment:

 

Turtle.prototype.weapon = 'Hands';

<< 'Hands'

 

We can also add a method to the prototype in a similar way:

Turtle.prototype.attack = function(){

return `Feel the power of my ${this.weapon}!`;

}

<< [Function]

 

Notice that there’s a reference to this.weapon in the prototype attack() method, and when the instance calls the attack() method, it uses the instance’s weapon property. This is because this in the prototype always refers to the instance that actually calls the method.

 

Finding Out the Prototype:  3 ways:

raph.constructor.prototype;  //constructor prototype property

<< Turtle { attack: [Function], weapon: 'Hands' }

 

Object.getPrototypeOf(raph);   //method takes object as parameter

<< Turtle { attack: [Function], weapon: 'Hands' } 

 

raph.__proto__                        // dunder proto (double underscore proto)

<< Turtle { attack: [Function], weapon: 'Hands' }

 

The prototype object is live, so if a new property or method is added to the prototype, any instances of its class will inherit the new properties and methods automatically, even if that instance has already been created.

 

What Should the Prototype Be Used For?

The prototype can be used to add any new properties and methods after the class has been declared. It should be used to define any properties that will remain the same for every instance of the class. CAUTION: A golden rule to remember is: Never use arrays or objects as a default value in prototype.

 

Summary

Create a class declaration that deals with any initialization, shared properties

and methods.

Any extra methods and properties that need to be augmented to the class declaration after it’s been defined can be added to the prototype. These will be added to all instances, even those that have already been created.

Add any properties or methods that are individual to a particular instance can be augmented using assignment to that object (a mixin could be used to add multiple properties at once, as we’ll see later).

Be careful when overwriting the prototype completely ― the constructor class

CHAPTER 15

MODERN JS DEVELOPMENT

Libraries: A JavaScript library is a piece of code that provides several methods that make it easier to achieve common tasks. A library will abstract functionality into easier-to-use functions and methods. These can then be used to complete common tasks without having to use lots of repetitive code. A library can reduce the amount of code you have to write, as well as making common tasks easier to implement. Popular libraries such as jQuery are often well-tested, and help to iron out edge cases and bugs in older browsers that would be difficult to do with your own code.

 

DOM Manipulation using library: Using a jQuery library a single line of code can append another paragraph

$(para).addClass('important').append('<p>Another Paragraph</p>');

 

jQuery: the most popular of all the JavaScript libraries used today. It is used in a huge number of commercial websites and has a plugin system that makes it easy to extend and use to build common web page elements, such as a lightbox or carousel widget. A big advantage of using jQuery is its support for older browsers, particularly Internet Explorer.

 

Underscore & Lodash: are very similar libraries of functions that provide additional functionality to the language. They both provide a large number of utility functions under the namespace _ (this is where these libraries get their name from as the _ character is often referred to as an underscore or a lodash). A number of JavaScript libraries list one of these as a core dependency.

 

Advantages and Disadvantages: A big advantage of utilizing a popular library is that it will be used by lots of people and thoroughly tested. It will most likely have been optimized and battletested for nearly every eventuality. Using a library means you can be confident that your code will be as bullet-proof as possible in many browsers. There are some disadvantages to using libraries, however. You need to include the code for the library as well as your own code. This increases the amount of code that needs to be downloaded by a website, which in some cases can cause performance issues. Thankfully, most modern libraries are relatively small once server-side optimizations are made (such as gzip compression), minimizing any

latency issues. Another problem with libraries is that they might fail to implement the functionality in the precise way that you want it to perform.

 

 

Modular JS   - using export and import

A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods

that can then be used in other files and by other modules. This helps to keep code

organized in separate, reusable files, which improves code maintainability.

A ES6 module file is just a normal JavaScript file, but uses the keyword export to specify any values or functions that are to be made available from the module.

For example, a very simple Pi module would have the following code saved in a file called pi.js:

export const PI = 3.1415926;

This would then be imported into your main JavaScript file, main.js using the following code:

import { PI } from './pi.js'; //allows use of PI in main.js

 

Functions can also be exported from a module.

 

Default Exports: refer to a single variable, function or class in a module that can be imported without having to be explicitly named. The syntax for default exports is purposely easier to read because this is how modules were designed to be used. With default exports you don’t need to use curly braces or make any mention of the value that is being imported.

 

The following example demonstrates how this would be done for a variable:

const PI = 3.145926;

export default PI;

Then use it as follows:

import PI from './pi.js';

 

Node.js Modules: notation called Common JS modules. Common JS module is created in a separate file, and the module.exports method is used to make any functions available to  other files.

Create module inside a file called squareFunction.js:

module.exports = x => x * x;

To use the module, it needs to then be required inside the another JS file. This is done using the require() method.

const square = require('./squareFunction');

 

 

MVC Frameworks: Starts on page 584. May need this later as many of the examples are related to a TO-DO-LIST project.

 Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a design pattern that’s been used for a long time in server-side languages. It’s a common way of designing software, and used by server-side frameworks such as Ruby On Rails and Django. In recent years it has been used in JavaScript code to make it easier to organize large-scale web applications.

MVC separates an application into three distinct, independent components that interact with each other:

Models: objects that implement the functionality for creating, reading, updating and deleting (known as CRUD tasks) specific pieces of information about the application, as well as any other associated logic and behavior.

Views: provide a visual representation of the model showing all the relevant information. In a web application, this would be the HTML displayed on a web page. Views also provide a way for users to interact with an application, usually via forms.

Controllers: link models and views together by communicating between them. They respond to events, which are usually inputs from a user (entering some data into a form, for example), process the information, then update the model and view accordingly.

 

 

Templates: Many MVC frameworks use templating languages to insert dynamic data into the

page. They can be whole web pages but are often partial pages. This means that the application can update part of the page without having to make a request to the server, saving an HTTP request. The templates are often stored in separate files or inside their own script tags, so they can be reused and quickly edited in one place if changes need to be made.

 

View Libraries: Over the past few years, a number of libraries have sprung up that deal with just the view layer of MVC. They have the single goal of making it easier to update the user interface while also keeping what is displayed synchronized with underlying data that it’s representing. This means they can be integrated into a project and used either on their own or alongside other libraries that deal with other aspects of the application. The two view libraries that have emerged as the most popular so far are React and Vue.js.(Page 593)

 

Package Managers: allow developers to download modules from a central repository. A package is just a directory with one or more files of code, as well as a package.json file that contains information about the code in the package.

Npm: (See page 595)

The Node Package Manager was developed soon after Node.js was introduced to allow JavaScript code to be shared by developers. It has since grown into the largest repository of code libraries available.

This is a lot of good reference information in this section. Learn how to finalize your code, standard folder structures, minification, transplicers and other good things when deploying JavaScript.

REVIEW CHAPTER 6 Document Object Model

DOM: allows you to access elements of a web page and enable interaction with the page by adding and removing elements, changing the order, content and attributes of elements, and even altering how they are styled.

CHAPTER 10

TESTING and DEBUGGING (Exploring things on my own)

Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings

Programmer errors are our responsibility, so we must ensure they are minimized as much as possible and fixed promptly. We also should try to limit user errors by predicting any possible interactions that may throw an error, and ensure they are dealt with in a way that doesn’t negatively affect the user experience.

 

Exceptions: An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.

 

Stack Traces: An exception will also produce a stack trace.  This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred. It’s often not just a

single function or method call that causes an error. A stack trace will work backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the original function or method that started the sequence.

 

Warnings: occurs when an error in the code exists that isn’t bad enough to cause a crash.

 

Strict Mode: produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features.

Add it to the first line of a JS file:

‘use strict’;

 

Linting Tools: Linting tools such as JS Lint,1 JS Hint,2 and ES Lint3 can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode. They are designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain if certain style conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented.

 

Feature Detection: The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use feature detection. This is done using an if statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying to actually call the method. For example, say we want to use the shiny new holoDeck API (as far as I know, this doesn’t actually exist ... yet), we would wrap any method calls inside the following if block:

if (window.holoDeck) {

virtualReality.activate();

}

Will not even run if object does not exists, otherwise an error would have been thrown.

 

Debugging in the Browser

Alert: The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog at certain points in the code. Because alert() stops a program from running until OK is clicked, it allows us to effectively put breakpoints in the code that let us check the value of variables at that point to see if they’re what we expect them to be.

 

Using the Console: console.log() very helpful. Console.trace() logs an interactive stack trace in the console.

 

Debugging Tools: Most modern browsers also have a debugging tool that allows you to set breakpoints in your code that will pause it at certain points. You can then see the values of all the variables at those points and modify them. This can be very useful when trying to track down bugs.

One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to.

See example:

function amIOldEnough(age){

debugger;  //remove this later

if (age < 12) {

debugger;

return 'No, sorry.';

} else if (age < 18) {

debugger;

return 'Only if you are accompanied by an adult.';

} else {

debugger;

return 'Yep, come on in!';

}

}

 

Error Objects: An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function, like so:

const error = new Error();

This constructor function takes a parameter that’s used as the error message:

const error = new Error('Oops, something went wrong');

Some error objects are created automatically. We can access the name, message, and stack properties of error objects.

 

Throwing Exceptions: Can throw your own exceptions using the

throw statement. This will allow for any problems in your code to be highlighted and dealt with, rather than lurk quietly in the background. It is best practice to throw an error object. This can then be caught in a catch block, which is covered later in the chapter:

throw new Error('Something has gone badly wrong!');

 

Example of throw inside a function. Cannot find square root of negative number so throw and exception:

function squareRoot(number) {

'use strict';

if (number < 0) {

throw new RangeError('You cannot find the square root of

negative numbers')

}

return Math.sqrt(number);

};

 

Exception Handling: It is possible to handle exceptions gracefully by catching the error. Any errors can be hidden from users, but still identified. We can then deal with the error appropriately ― perhaps even ignore it ― and keep the program running.

Try, Catch, Finally blocks are used to try and catch exceptions and finally block runs after catch block regardless of whether an exception occurred.

function imaginarySquareRoot(number) {

'use strict';

let answer;

try {

answer = String(squareRoot(number));

} catch(error) {

answer = squareRoot(-number)+"i";

} finally {

return `+ or - ${answer}`;

}

}

 

Tests: Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked. Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops, and any errors will be identified early on. A test can simply be a function that tests a piece of code runs as it should. For example, we could test that the squareRoot() function that we wrote earlier

returns the correct answer with the following function:

function itSquareRoots4() {

return squareRoot(4) === 2;

}

Here we’re comparing the result of squareRoot(4) with the number 2. This will return true if our function works as expected, which it does:

itSquareRoots4();

<< true

 

Test-driven Development: TDD is the process of writing tests before any actual code. Obviously these tests will initially fail, because there is no code to test. The next step is to write some code to make the tests pass. After this, the code is refactored to make it faster, more readable, and remove any repetition. The code is continually tested at each stage to make sure it continues to work. This process should be followed in small piecemeal chunks every time a new feature is

Implemented.

 

Testing Frameworks: provide a structure to write meaningful tests and then run them. There are a large number of frameworks available for JavaScript, but we’ll be focusing on the Jest framework.

Jest, created by Facebook, is very popular. (see page369 for installation instructions using npm install -g jest, jest -v)

Usage:  Should be placed in separate js file like squareRoot.test.js (Jest looks for files named this way)

function squareRoot(number) {

'use strict';

if (number < 0) {

throw new RangeError("You can't find the square root of

negative numbers")

}

return Math.sqrt(number);

};

test('square root of 4 is 2', () => {

expect(squareRoot(4)).toBe(2);

});

 

The test would be executed by Jest using the following inside the directory where the .test.js file is:

Jest -c {}

 

The first parameter of the test() function is a string that

describes what we are testing, in this case that ‘square root of 4 is 2’. The second parameter is an anonymous function that contains a function called expect(), which takes the function we’re testing as an argument, and returns an expectation

object. The expectation object has a number of methods called matchers. In the example above, the matcher is toBe(), which tests to see if the value returned by our squareRoot() function is the same as the value provided as an argument (2,

in this case). These matchers are named so they read like an English sentence, making them easier to understand (even for non-programmers), and the feedback they provide more meaningful.

 

Result of jest test should look something like:

<< PASS ./squareRoot.test.js

✓ square root of 4 is 2 (2ms)
