  <h2>Roads Module</h2>

  <h3>Write a CommonJS module, based on the example from Chapter 7, that contains the array of roads and exports the graph data structure representing them as roadGraph. It should depend on a module ./graph, which exports a function buildGraph that is used to build the graph. This function expects an array of two-element arrays (the start and end points of the roads).</h3>

  <h3>Check the console for the answers.</h3>

  <script>
  // Add dependencies and exports


  const roads = [
    "Alice's House-Bob's House",   "Alice's House-Cabin",
    "Alice's House-Post Office",   "Bob's House-Town Hall",
    "Daria's House-Ernie's House", "Daria's House-Town Hall",
    "Ernie's House-Grete's House", "Grete's House-Farm",
    "Grete's House-Shop",          "Marketplace-Farm",
    "Marketplace-Post Office",     "Marketplace-Shop",
    "Marketplace-Town Hall",       "Shop-Town Hall"
  ];

  exports.roadGraph = buildGraph(roads.map(r => r.split("-")));
