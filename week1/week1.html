  <h2>Week 1 Notes</h2>
    <p>Focused mostly on exercises. Was able to read all the chapters and work the exercises as a review. The most helpful activity was to insert comments which translate the javascript code to English in main.js</p>
    <h3>Questions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Is localStorage a popular way to persist data in real world applications? Or is it just a work around when we don't want to deal with sessions, or even an actual database?
